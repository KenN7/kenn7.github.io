# Introduction

In groups, you are going to make a small presentation on a piece of software
or technology or your choice.
We will measure your capacity to analyse and transfer your knowledge about
technical subjects.


# Presentation

You prepare a 15-minute presentation (followed by questions from the audience)
that will be presented during the last two courses. 

During this presentation, you will present a technology or piece of software
in the light of the different broad topics you encountered during the course.
Your presentation should start with a presentation of the subject in board terms
with some context. 
Depending on your choice of subject, if your subject is very broad, you will
focus on a specific application or aspect of the subject.
You present a use case or specific application and then
make an analysis, in terms of software architecture, quality, security
concerns, and deliverability concerns.

You are expected to dig in to the subject and should not be superficial.

Your presentation should end by presenting 3 questions (and answers) that
one might ask about your work.

Those questions may be selected as part as the final exam.

# Evaluation

You will be graded based on your presentations quality, the technical relevance
of the subject, and the context.


The presentation should be uploaded to moodle before **09/05/2022 13:00**.


The presentation material will then be available for everyone, some questions 
of the final exam quizz may be based on information you will learn during those
presentations.
