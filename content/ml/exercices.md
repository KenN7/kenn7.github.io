# Introduction

The exercises proposed during the practical sessions of the machine learning
course are based on the mini-courses available on the 
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) platform.

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is an online community of data scientists 
and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish 
data sets, explore and build models, work with other data scientists and 
machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

Kaggle has embedded notebooks similar to [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
that allows one to experiment and build machine learning algorithms in a fully
web-based environment.

# Exercices

We will ask you to fulfill the following mini-courses available in the 
["courses" section of kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn):

- [Intro to machine learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)

- [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

- [Intermediate machine learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)

- [Feature engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)

- [Intro to deep learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)

- [Computer vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision)

# Project

You will have to analyse and train a model on the following task:

[Xente fraud detection challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/xente-fraud-detection-challenge)

At the end of your project, you should produce a report that contains:
all the analysis of the dataset and the feature engineering that you did,
the performance of your model, and a comparison with different other models.
The quality of the scientific reasoning is equally as important as the
performance of your model.

# Assessment

You will be assessed of two works:

- A **short written interogation** that will be held at 
the **end of the last lab** session. 
The content will be based on the technical content of the kaggle exercices.

- The project: report and code should be uploaded to claco.
