# Introduction

In groups, you are going to make a small presentation on a specific 
implementation of a NoSQL database of your choice, along with a 
showcase app and technical report.

# Choosing a database and testing it 

First choose a NoSQL database that you want to try out.

Then prepare a showcase app project using your database:

- Choose a domain of application (e.g. blog articles, social media comments,
  recipe list, store inventory, etc.)
- Present the data to be saved and your data model
- Build a small app to interact with the database, and present basic
operations one would want to make.
- Make a tutorial on how to install and use the database and your basic app. 

# Presentation

You prepare a 15-minute presentation (followed by questions from the audience)
for the last course about one NoSQL database. 

During this presentation, you will introduce the basic aspects of the
database you chose including (but not exclusively): Implementation, type of DB
(key-value, document, column, graph), basic features of this type of DB, 
consistency model, implication of such model, features of the specific
implementation of your DB, specificities of your DB, 
use cases, presentation on how to interact with the database (API?, language?)
(with examples).

You will also present your showcase app.

# Report

Based on your showcase app, you will produce a small tutorial (pdf format)
on how to install the database of your choice, populate it with data, and
use your app.

# Evaluation

You will be graded based on the quality of your presentation, report and
showcase app.

The report, presentation and sources, should be uploaded to claco before **12/12/2022 20:00**.
