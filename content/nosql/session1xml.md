### Beef Parmesan with Garlic Angel Hair Pasta

#### Ingredients
  
- 1 1/2 pounds beef cube steak
- 1 onion, sliced into thin rings
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced in rings
- 1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 12 ounces angel hair pasta
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1/4 cup butter

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 175 degrees C.
 
Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the bread crumbs
and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, and saute 1
teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry (brown quickly on both sides)
meat. Place meat in a casserole baking dish, slightly overlapping edges.
Place onion rings and peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce
over all.
 
Bake at 175 degrees C for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over meat and leave in the
oven till bubbly.
 
Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon garlic. For a
stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top with grated parmesan
and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce atop a mound of pasta! 

HINT:
make the meat ahead of time, and refrigerate over night, the acid in the
tomato sauce will tenderize the meat even more. If you do this, save the
mozzarella till the last minute.
