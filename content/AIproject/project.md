# Introduction

<img src="/AIproject/ocr.jpg" alt="Char recognition app" width=100% />

## Character recognition 

We want to create an app to automatically detect and recognize characters in
documents.
Specifically, we want to be able to read students' copies and grade them
automatically.

This project is multidisciplinary, you will leverage your knowledge of machine
learning, learn new techniques, and also use your knowledge of programming,
web development, and ergonomics.

## Features

### Minimal

- A web app, where I can upload image files or pdf files, process them, and get
  the results in a structured format and save them.
- I want to browse the history of processed files.
- I want to read digits anywhere on a page, or in a configurable zone of the
  page.

### Intermediate

- I want to be able to read printed characters anywhere on the page, or in a
  configurable zone of the page.
- I can take pictures of pages directly from my smartphone.

### Advanced

- I want to be able to read single letters or digits handwritten characters,
  anywhere on the page, or in a configurable zone of the page.

### Awesome

- I want to be able to read complete sentences of handwriten characters,
  anywhere in the page, or in a configurable zone of the page.

## Tools

You can use any tools you want, both for the web and for the machine learning
parts.
You can use any programming language, any existing dataset you can find online,
any pre-trained machine learning model (do not forget to cite your sources).

Training (or re-training) your own model for any part of the project will be appreciated.

# Evaluation

## Grading

The project should be done in groups of 2 or 3 students.
The report, presentation, and sources should be uploaded to claco.

The evaluation is separated into 3 parts: 
- how well your app works, its performance on some unseen examples, the machine
  learning techniques (50%),
- the ergonomics, functionalities and overall look & feel (25%),
- the presentation and questions (25%).


## Presentation

As a **group**, you prepare a 15-minute presentation to be presented during 
the exam session.
For the presentation: justify your choices, present your results, and make a
demonstration of your app (with eventual limits?).

The presentation will be followed by a 15-minute interview with some general
questions about your project, such as organizational details, technical
details, and general knowledge of the machine learning techniques that you applied.

Although the project presentation is done in groups, the interview, will be
**individual**.
