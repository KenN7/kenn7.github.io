# Introduction

<img src="/AIproject/ocr.jpg" alt="Smart image galery" width=100% />

## Smart image galery

We want to create a smart image galery. Your image galery should have the
following features: Automatic detection of persons and possibly animals.
Identifying a person and being capable of detecting all occurences of a 
specific person accross images, being able to filter by person.

This project is multidisciplinary, you will leverage your knowledge of machine
learning, learn new techniques, and also use your knowledge of programming,
web development, and ergonomics.

## Features

- A web app, where I can upload image files and they get processed.
- The app processes the images and detects humans.
- The app detects animals in images.
- The app clusters and identifies humans and animals 
- It is possible to filter images by humans in them.
- It is possible to filter images by types of animals in them.

## Tools

You can use any tools you want, both for the web and for the machine learning
parts.
You can use any programming language, any existing dataset you can find online,
any pre-trained machine learning model (do not forget to cite your sources).

There should be a machine learning model trained by you in one part of the project.

# Evaluation

## Grading

The project should be done in groups of 2 or 3 students.
The report, presentation, and sources should be uploaded to claco.

The evaluation is separated into 3 parts: 
- how well your app works, its performance on some unseen examples, the machine
  learning techniques (50%),
- the ergonomics, functionalities and overall look & feel (25%),
- the presentation and questions (25%).


## Presentation

As a **group**, you prepare a 15-minute presentation to be presented during 
the exam session.
For the presentation: justify your choices, present your results, and make a
demonstration of your app (with eventual limits?).

The presentation will be followed by 15 minutes of questions.
