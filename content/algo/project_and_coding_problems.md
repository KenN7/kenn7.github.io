# Project 

In groups, you are going to make a small presentation on an algorithm
or algorithmic technique of your choice.
The list of presentation and subjects is available on claco.

You present the algorithm, or algorithmic technique, the context
when it is used, some applications, possibly some visualisations.

Your presentation should be 15min long, it should be clear,
entertaining, and allow everyone to understand what is the concept 
you are talking about and why it exists.

The presentation account for 70% of your final grade and 
will take place during the last session of the course.

# Coding problem assignement

## Introduction

You should solve some problems from [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
2022 edition (starting december 1).
Advent Of Code is an advent calendar for coding exercises, each day of december,
a new problem is unlocked and available for solving. Each problem has 2 levels,
in order to get a double *gold* star, you need to solve both levels of the problem.

In groups of $n$ student you should get at least $7 \cdot n$ double gold stars
(with $ 0 < n \leq 3$).

Those exercises account for 30% of your final grade.

## Submission

Please provide a screenshot of your Advent Of Code dashboard showing your user
at the top right (example below for 2020), that shows at least $5 \cdot n$ double gold stars.

You will upload all your code and your screenshot as an archive on claco.
