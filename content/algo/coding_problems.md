# Coding problem assignement

## Introduction

You should solve some problems from [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
2023 edition (starting december 1).
Advent Of Code is an advent calendar for coding exercises, each day of december,
a new problem is unlocked and available for solving. Each problem has 2 levels,
in order to get a double *gold* star, you need to solve both levels of the problem.

In groups of $n$ student(s) you should get at least $\left\lceil 7 \cdot \log_2 (n+1) \right\rceil$ double gold stars
(with $ 0 < n \leq 3$).

Those exercises account for 30% of your final grade.

## Submission

Please provide a screenshot of your Advent Of Code dashboard showing your user
at the top right (example below for 2020), that shows at least $\left\lceil 7 \cdot \log_2 (n+1) \right\rceil$ double gold stars.

You will upload all your code and your screenshot as an archive on claco.
